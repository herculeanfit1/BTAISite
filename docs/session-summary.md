- ✅ All API routes have JSDoc comments explaining their purpose

## Code Quality & Cleanup

- ⚠️ TypeScript errors exist in the codebase (82 errors in 22 files)
- ⚠️ Console log statements remain in some files and should be removed or replaced with proper logging
- ✅ Created deployment documentation for email function integration

## Testing & Validation

- ⚠️ Some unit tests are failing (2 failed, 75 passed, 5 skipped)
- ⚠️ Manual testing of email functionality required per test placeholders
- ✅ Created test results template document for email function testing

## Build & Performance

- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ⚠️ Fetch errors occur during build due to missing API endpoints (expected during static build)
- ✅ Output sizes and routes look reasonable

## Security Checks

- ✅ Content Security Policy headers are present in the application
- ⚠️ Email function security requires proper key management (documented in `docs/email-function-fix.md`)
- ✅ Input validation exists in contact form and API routes

## Environment Configuration

- ✅ Created `docs/env-template.md` with required environment variables
- ⚠️ Missing formal `.env.example` file (unable to create due to permissions)
- ✅ Documented environment variables needed for email function

## Completed Items

1. Email function integration documentation
   - ✅ Created `docs/email-function-deployment.md`
   - ✅ Created `docs/email-function-test-results.md`

# BridgingTrustAI - Session Summary

## Session 12 - Security Improvements and Home Page Layout Reorganization

### Tasks Completed
1. Replaced HTML anchor tags with Next.js Link components across the site for proper client-side navigation
2. Fixed RootErrorBoundary.tsx to use useRouter().refresh() instead of window.location.reload()

4. Updated SocialShare.tsx to handle URL construction safely for SSR and client-side rendering
5. Improved ContactForm.tsx to use Link component for the Privacy Policy link
6. Fixed the layout.tsx file to properly use the RootErrorBoundary component
