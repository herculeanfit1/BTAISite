## 2024-05-13: Adding Favicons to the Website

### Prompt

"Can you take the company logo on the homepage and shrink it down into a favicon so that we can have it on the browser title bar? Currently, it's a small icon with the letter L in it. I would like to replace it with a smaller version of the company logo."

### Context

We needed to replace the default browser favicon (showing an "L") with a proper favicon derived from the Bridging Trust AI logo. We implemented a complete favicon solution that works across different browsers and devices.

### Implementation

1. Created a Node.js script (`scripts/generate-favicon.js`) that:
   - Uses the Sharp library to process images
   - Generates favicon files in various sizes from the SVG logo
   - Creates all necessary configuration files

2. Generated a comprehensive set of favicon files:
   - Standard favicons (16x16 to 512x512)
   - Apple Touch Icons for iOS devices
   - Android Chrome icons
   - Microsoft Tile icons
   
3. Added the favicon references to the app's metadata in `app/layout.tsx` using Next.js 15's metadata API

4. Created documentation in `docs/favicon-guide.md` explaining:
   - How favicons are organized
   - How to regenerate them if needed
   - How to test and troubleshoot favicon issues
