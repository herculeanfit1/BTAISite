# Dependency Maintenance Strategy

This document outlines our approach to dependency management, ensuring that our project remains secure, stable, and up-to-date.

## Maintenance Schedule

| Timeframe   | Action Items                                       | Responsible Team  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Weekly      | Review and merge security-related Dependabot PRs   | Maintainers       |
| Monthly     | Run full audit and address minor dependency issues | Development Team  |
| Quarterly   | Conduct comprehensive dependency review and update | Lead Developers   |
| Bi-annually | Major version upgrades for core dependencies       | Architecture Team |

## Key Dependencies and Version Requirements

- **Node.js**: v20.19.1 LTS
- **React**: 18.2.0
- **Next.js**: 15.3.2
- **Tailwind CSS**: 4.1.5
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.5
- **Vitest**: 3.1.3

## Dependency Management Guidelines

### 1. Version Pinning

- All dependencies in `package.json` must use exact versions (no `^` or `~` prefixes)
- This is enforced by the dependency validation workflow

### 2. Security Updates

- Security updates are automatically proposed by Dependabot
- Security PRs should be reviewed and merged within 1 week
- Critical vulnerabilities should be addressed within 24 hours

### 3. Dependency Additions

Before adding a new dependency:

1. Check if the functionality already exists in the codebase or in an existing dependency
2. Evaluate the dependency's maintenance status, stability, and security history
3. Consider bundle size impact
4. Ensure compatibility with our Node.js version and other dependencies
5. Document the addition in the PR

### 4. Node.js Version Updates

- Node.js version updates should be planned at least 1 month in advance
- Update both `.nvmrc` and the `engines` field in `package.json` simultaneously
- Test thoroughly across all environments before deployment

### 5. Major Version Upgrades

For major version upgrades of core dependencies:

1. Create a dedicated feature branch
2. Document all breaking changes and required code modifications
3. Update related dependencies as needed
4. Run comprehensive tests including performance benchmarks
5. Deploy to staging environment for extended testing
6. Schedule a planned release window

## Automated Safeguards

Our repository includes several automated checks:

1. **Dependency Validation Workflow**: Ensures all dependencies use exact versions and the lockfile is in sync
2. **Security Audit**: Runs `npm audit` to detect vulnerabilities
3. **Dependabot**: Configured to automatically propose security fixes

## Dependency Documentation

All major dependency decisions should be documented:

- Document framework upgrades in dedicated ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Keep this dependency maintenance document updated
- Update `docs/nextjs-tailwind-v4-fixes.md` with any Tailwind or Next.js specific issues and solutions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Conflicting Dependencies

If you encounter peer dependency conflicts:

1. Use `npm ls <package-name>` to identify which packages depend on conflicting versions
2. Consider using `npm dedupe` to eliminate duplicate packages
3. As a last resort, use the resolutions/overrides field to force a specific version

### Build Failures After Updates

1. Check if the failure is related to a specific dependency
2. Review the dependency's changelog for breaking changes
3. Check for compatibility issues with our current Node.js version
4. Temporarily roll back if necessary while investigating
