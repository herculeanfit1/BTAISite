# Testing Infrastructure Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the recent updates to the testing infrastructure for the Bridging Trust AI website. We have expanded our testing coverage with both unit and integration tests, and set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Key Components Tested

### UI Components

We've added comprehensive tests for several key components:

1. **NetworkMotifSection**

   - Tests default rendering with expected content
   - Verifies custom title and subtitle functionality
   - Confirms custom class application
   - Checks all feature cards render correctly with descriptions

2. **OptimizedImage**

   - Tests required props (src, alt) rendering
   - Verifies custom dimensions are applied correctly
   - Confirms loading state transitions
   - Tests priority image loading
   - Validates custom aspect ratio application

3. **BookingEmbed**

   - Tests default and custom title/description rendering
   - Validates iframe loading with loading spinner
   - Confirms proper URL selection (MS Bookings vs Calendly)
   - Tests custom height and className application

4. **Newsletter Form**
   - Tests form validation (required fields)
   - Verifies form submission with correct data
   - Confirms error handling for API failures
   - Tests loading state during submission
   - Validates dark/light mode and compact versions

## Integration Tests

We've enhanced our integration testing to cover key user flows:

1. **Blog Search Functionality**

   - Tests component mounting and initial state
   - Verifies search query debouncing and API calls
   - Tests category and tag filtering
   - Validates clearing filters functionality

2. **Form Validation and Submission**

   - Tests client-side validation for required fields
   - Validates email format checking
   - Confirms successful form submission process
   - Tests server-side validation error handling
   - Verifies loading states during submission

3. **Theme Switching**
   - Tests theme toggle button rendering
   - Verifies switching from light to dark theme
   - Tests switching from dark to light theme
   - Confirms appropriate icons display in each theme mode

## CI/CD Pipeline

We've set up a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD:

1. **Lint Job**

   - Runs ESLint to ensure code quality standards

2. **Build Job**

   - Performs TypeScript type checking
   - Builds the project for production
   - Analyzes bundle size for performance monitoring

3. **Testing Jobs**

   - Unit tests with coverage reports
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests with Playwright

4. **Performance Job**

   - Runs Lighthouse for performance analysis
   - Captures results for performance monitoring

5. **Deploy Job**

   - Deploys to Azure Static Web Apps
   - Configured for main branch only

6. **Notification Job**
   - Sends deployment status notifications

## Performance Optimizations

Along with testing improvements, we've implemented performance optimizations:

1. **Bundle Analysis**

   - Added `@next/bundle-analyzer` for bundle size monitoring
   - Created npm script for analyzing build

2. **Image Optimization**

   - Enhanced next/image configuration
   - Added support for AVIF and WebP formats
   - Configured optimal remotePatterns for external images

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Implemented webpack optimizations for better code splitting
   - Configured selective imports for third-party libraries
   - Added React resolution to prevent duplicate libraries

## Next Steps

Future testing improvements planned:

1. **End-to-end Testing**

   - Implement E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Add more comprehensive flow testing

2. **Visual Regression Testing**

   - Set up screenshot comparison tests
   - Automate UI regression detection

3. **Accessibility Testing**

   - Implement automated accessibility testing
   - Integrate with CI pipeline

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Add Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Implement performance budgets

## Running Tests

To run the tests locally:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

To analyze bundle size:

```bash
npm run analyze
```
