# Security and Test Suite Updates for Static Export

This document outlines the security improvements and test suite updates implemented to support the static export approach for the Bridging Trust AI website.

## Security Improvements

### Vulnerability Remediation

1. **Removed Critical Vulnerabilities**:
   - Eliminated `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` package which had a dependency on `libxmljs2` with critical vulnerabilities
   - Replaced the SBOM generation script with a simpler `npm list --json` approach
   - Removed related configuration and scripts from package.json

2. **Security Audit Results**:
   - Production dependencies now have 0 vulnerabilities
   - Development dependencies have only low-severity vulnerabilities that don't affect production code
   - All security headers are managed via staticwebapp.config.json for the static site

3. **Object Injection Prevention**:
   - Improved type checking throughout the codebase
   - ESLint security rules are now properly enforced
   - Fixed issues with unchecked user inputs

## Test Suite Updates

### Static Export Compatibility

1. **Middleware Test Updates**:
   - Completely rewrote middleware tests to verify the absence of middleware files
   - Tests now validate that no middleware.ts/js files exist in the project
   - Confirm that both next.config.js and next.config.cjs are properly configured for static export

2. **Component Test Fixes**:
   - Fixed NavBar tests to look for appropriate DOM elements instead of navigation roles
   - Updated ThemeToggle tests to match the current implementation that enforces light theme
   - Ensured all component tests are compatible with the static HTML output approach

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Components now have appropriate ARIA labels
   - Tests verify that accessible elements are present and correctly labeled
   - Improved semantic HTML structure for better screen reader compatibility

## Configuration Verification

The test suite now verifies these key configurations for static export:

1. **next.config.js/cjs**:
   - Verifies `output: "export"` is set
   - Confirms `images.unoptimized: true` is configured for static image compatibility
   - Checks that other required static export settings are in place

2. **Image Optimization**:
   - Since the Next.js Image Optimization API is not available in static exports, the tests verify that:
   - All images use the `unoptimized` setting
   - Components handle images appropriately for static rendering

3. **Client-Side Navigation**:
   - Tests confirm that links use Next.js Link component for proper client-side navigation
   - Ensures no server-side only features are being used

## Running Tests

To verify that all tests pass with the static export approach:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites for static export compatibility
npm test __tests__/middleware.test.ts __tests__/next-config.test.ts
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Ongoing Security Monitoring**:
   - Regular security audits should be performed
   - Dependency updates should be applied promptly
   - Any new features should be designed with static export compatibility in mind

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Consider increasing test coverage for components
   - Add more specific tests for static export compatibility
   - Implement visual regression testing for the static output

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - The static site should be tested for Core Web Vitals performance
   - Lighthouse scores should be monitored and improved
   - Load testing should verify CDN performance
