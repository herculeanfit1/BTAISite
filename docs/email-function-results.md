# Email Function Test Results

## Test Date: May 13, 2025

## Test Environment
- Azure Function App: btai-email-relay
- Node.js Version: 20.x LTS
- Tester: AI Assistant

## Code Analysis Findings

After reviewing the relevant code files, I've identified important information about the email functionality:

1. **Azure Function Implementation**:
   - Function is properly implemented in `email-function/SendContactForm/index.js`
   - Uses Resend API for email delivery
   - Includes validation, sanitization, and error handling

2. **Website Integration**:
   - The website's contact form is defined in `app/components/ContactForm.tsx`
   - The form submits to `/api/send-email` endpoint, NOT to the Azure Function
   - The contact form API route is defined in `app/api/contact/route.ts`

3. **Key Discrepancy**:
   - The website's contact form submits to `/api/send-email` but we found the route at `/api/contact/route.ts`
   - This mismatch suggests an integration issue between the website and Azure Function
   - The current API route appears to be a placeholder that simulates success but doesn't actually send emails

## Automated Test Results

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Valid submission with all fields | Email sent successfully | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 2 | Valid submission without company | Email sent successfully | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 3 | Missing name field | 400 Bad Request | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 4 | Missing email field | 400 Bad Request | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 5 | Missing message field | 400 Bad Request | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 6 | Invalid email format | 400 Bad Request | No visible terminal response | Unknown |
| 7 | Empty request body | 400 Bad Request | No visible terminal response | Unknown |

## Integration Issues Identified

1. **Website-to-Function Integration Gap**:
   - ContactForm.tsx submits to `/api/send-email` but this endpoint wasn't found in the codebase
   - The contact API route (app/api/contact/route.ts) simulates success but doesn't connect to the Azure Function
   - The Azure Function exists but doesn't appear to be properly integrated with the website

2. **Production Integration Status**:
   - Email delivery cannot be verified because the website doesn't appear to be correctly calling the Azure Function
   - The current implementation simulates form submission success without actually sending emails

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Integration**:
   - Create or update the `/api/send-email` endpoint to properly forward requests to the Azure Function
   - Modify the form's submission URL if a different endpoint should be used
   - Ensure the API route's dynamic setting is appropriate for Azure Static Web Apps

2. **Manual Tests Required**:
   - Direct testing of Azure Function using tools like Postman or curl with appropriate parameters
   - Access to Azure Portal to verify function execution logs
   - Email inbox verification after direct function testing

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Consider having the contact form submit directly to the Azure Function if possible
   - This would eliminate the need for an intermediate API route

## Conclusion

The email function implementation appears to be technically sound, but there's a critical integration issue between the website's contact form and the Azure Function. The form is submitting to an endpoint that doesn't properly connect to the actual email sending function.

Before proceeding with further testing, the integration issue needs to be resolved. Once fixed, the full test suite can be executed to verify proper functionality in the production environment.

## Manual Test Results

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 8 | Long message content (5000+ characters) | Email sent successfully | Not tested yet | Pending |
| 9 | Special characters (Unicode, emojis) | Email sent successfully | Tested, but no visible response | Pending |
| 10 | Rate limiting (10 requests in 10 seconds) | Rate limit applied after threshold | Not tested yet | Pending |

## Website Integration Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 11 | Contact form submission from live site | Email sent and confirmation shown | Need to test on live site | Pending |
| 12 | Form validation - client side | Prevents invalid submissions | Need to test on live site | Pending |
| 13 | Form validation - server side | Returns appropriate error messages | Need to test on live site | Pending |

## Error Handling Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 14 | Missing environment variables | 500 error with specific message | Cannot test in production | N/A |
| 15 | Resend API error simulation | 500 error with appropriate message | Cannot test in production | N/A |
| 16 | Network connectivity issue | Graceful failure with error message | Cannot test in production | N/A |

## Email Delivery Quality

| Criteria | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Delivery time | Under 60 seconds | Need to check inbox | Pending |
| HTML formatting | Correctly rendered | Need to check inbox | Pending |
| Plain text alternative | Properly formatted | Need to check inbox | Pending |
| Reply-to field | Set to submitter's email | Need to check inbox | Pending |
| Subject line | "Contact Form: [Name]" | Need to check inbox | Pending |
| Spam filtering | Not marked as spam | Need to check inbox | Pending |

## Application Insights Metrics

These metrics need to be checked in the Azure Portal:
- Average function execution time
- Success rate
- Error rate
- Throttling incidents

## Observations and Next Steps

1. **Terminal Response Issues**:
   - Curl commands did not display visible responses in the terminal
   - This could be due to several factors:
     - The function may not be returning proper response bodies
     - There might be network connectivity issues
     - The function might be failing silently

2. **Required Manual Verification**:
   - Check email inbox for test messages (contact@bridgingtrust.ai)
   - Check Azure Function logs in the Azure Portal
   - Review Application Insights for any error telemetry
   - Test form submission on the live website

3. **Recommended Actions**:
   - Check Azure Portal Logs to verify function execution
   - Check email inbox to verify delivery
   - Update this document with findings
   - Consider enhancing error logging if issues are discovered
   - Test the website integration after verifying API is working

## Preliminary Conclusion

The email function testing through the command line did not provide visible response feedback, making it difficult to verify functionality solely through terminal-based testing. Further investigation is needed through the Azure Portal logs and verification of email delivery to determine if the function is working correctly.

Once email receipt is verified and Azure logs are checked, this document should be updated with the actual results to complete the testing process.
