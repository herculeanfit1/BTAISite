# Security Improvements for BridgingTrustAI

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the BridgingTrustAI website codebase to enhance security, strengthen type safety, and reduce vulnerabilities.

## Type Checking and Linting Improvements

- Re-enabled TypeScript type checking in next.config.js by setting `ignoreBuildErrors: false`
- Re-enabled ESLint checking in next.config.js by setting `ignoreDuringBuilds: false`
- Fixed all critical TypeScript errors to ensure type safety

## Object Injection Vulnerability Fixes

### Rate Limiting System

- Replaced object-based storage with Map-based data structures for tracking IP rate limits
- Added explicit bounds checking for array access in rate limiting code
- Implemented safe property access patterns to prevent prototype pollution

### API Routes

- Added proper type guards in contact form and newsletter subscription endpoints
- Implemented honeypot field checks with type-safe access
- Improved validation of request body parameters with Zod schema validation
- Enhanced sanitization of user inputs with proper string conversion and trimming

### 3D Globe Visualization

- Added proper type definitions with a `LineUserData` interface
- Implemented type guards before accessing properties that might not be present
- Added bounds checking when accessing array elements
- Fixed potential object injection points in the animation code

### UI Components

- Fixed LoadingSpinner component with type-safe size and color mapping
- Added validation of size and color parameters against allowed values
- Used type-safe data structures in TestimonialSection component with array bounds checking
- Improved safety of DataBlockHeader and FastPerformanceData components

## Client-Side Navigation Improvements

Replaced HTML anchor tags with Next.js Link components for proper client-side navigation in:

1. app/components/globe/GlobeSection.tsx
2. app/components/home/GlobeSection.tsx
3. app/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx
4. app/components/SocialShare.tsx
5. app/components/home/ContactSection.tsx
6. app/page.tsx
7. app/components/home/Header.tsx
8. app/components/home/FooterSection.tsx
9. app/components/BookingEmbed.tsx
10. app/contact/ContactForm.tsx

This provides:
- Prefetching for faster navigation
- Client-side transitions without full page reloads
- Automatic scroll restoration
- Better handling of internal vs. external links

## Window Object Safety

- Added proper guards for window object access in dynamic components
- Replaced direct window.location usages with Next.js router methods
- Used React useEffect hooks to safely access browser APIs only after component mount
- Fixed window-dependent code in blog search and social sharing components

## Remaining Improvements

The following improvements could be made in future updates:

1. Replace generic 'any' types with specific types in analytics and logging code
2. Clean up unused variables and imports flagged by ESLint
3. Implement stronger validation in UI test files 
4. Add proper error handling for API fetch failures
5. Consider using React Query or SWR for better data fetching patterns

## Build Status

The application now builds successfully without TypeScript errors. There are still ESLint warnings related to unused variables and generic object types that should be addressed in future updates.

## Client-Side Navigation and Window Object Safety

### Next.js Link Components
- Replaced all HTML anchor tags with Next.js Link components for proper client-side navigation
- This improves security by preventing full page reloads and maintaining application state
- Properly configured external links to use target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer"

### Safe Window Object Usage
- Fixed unsafe window.location.reload() usage in RootErrorBoundary.tsx by using Next.js router's refresh() method
- Updated BlogSearch.tsx to use useSearchParams hook instead of directly accessing window.location.search
- Modified SocialShare.tsx to safely handle URL construction with SSR-safe window access
- Improved component mounting patterns to avoid SSR/CSR hydration mismatches

### Error Handling Improvements
- Added better error handling in API routes with proper type checking
- Improved error logging in blog category page with structured error messages
- Removed debug console.log statements that could potentially leak sensitive information

### Build and Configuration Security
- Fixed Next.js configuration to properly handle static exports without creating security vulnerabilities
- Ensured proper environment variable handling with type checking
- Cleaned up unused dependencies that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities

These improvements help minimize client-side vulnerabilities and ensure proper security practices throughout the application.
