## Latest Updates

### Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade (Latest)

We've recently upgraded the project to use the latest stable versions of Next.js (v15.3.1), React (v19.0.0), and Tailwind CSS (v4.1.5). This upgrade provides numerous benefits:

- Improved performance with the latest React and Next.js optimizations
- Enhanced typesafety with Next.js 15's typed routes
- Modern CSS features with Tailwind v4's new capabilities
- Better developer experience with the latest tooling

The main aspects we've addressed in this upgrade:

1. **Configuration Changes**:

   - Updated package.json dependencies
   - Converted to ESM format by adding "type": "module"
   - Updated Tailwind CSS configuration for v4
   - Modified PostCSS configuration to use the new @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
   - Updated ESLint configuration to use the new format

2. **Type Safety Improvements**:

   - Created `lib/route-types.ts` for proper Route type definitions
   - Updated components to use Route<string> for href properties
   - Fixed dynamic route usage with proper type casting

3. **API Routes**:

   - Made API routes compatible with static export using 'force-static'
   - Working on fixing issues with routes using search parameters

4. **Known Issues**:
   - Blog search route has issues with static export due to nextUrl.searchParams usage
   - Some components may still need Route<string> type updates
   - Need to address potential SSR hydration warnings from React 19

See the [todo.md](./todo.md) file for a detailed list of completed and remaining tasks related to this upgrade.
