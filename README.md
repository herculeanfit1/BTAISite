### Installation & Setup

To manage Node.js versions, we strongly recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager):

```bash
# Install NVM (if not already installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Install and use the required Node.js version
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

# Verify installation
node -v  # Should output v20.x.x
npm -v   # Should show the compatible npm version
```

## Development

### Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (recommended)
npm run dev:http

# Alternative: Standard Next.js dev server
npm run dev:next
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Development Scripts

```bash
npm run dev:http     # HTTP development server (recommended)
npm run dev          # HTTPS development server  
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Production server
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation
```

### Environment Setup

For local email testing, create `.env.local`:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=hello@bridgingtrust.ai
EMAIL_TO=sales@bridgingtrust.ai
EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@bridgingtrust.ai
RESEND_TEST_MODE=true
```

## UI Testing

This project includes an automated UI testing suite using Playwright. These tests validate the functionality and appearance of the website across different browsers and viewports.

### Test Structure

- **Page Tests**: Located in `src/uitests/pages/`, these test specific pages:

  - `home.spec.ts`: Tests for the homepage
  - `about.spec.ts`: Tests for the about page
  - `services.spec.ts`: Tests for the services page
  - `contact.spec.ts`: Tests for the contact page

- **Utility Functions**: Located in `src/uitests/utils/test-utils.ts`, providing reusable test functionality:
  - Dark mode testing
  - Responsive design testing
  - Accessibility testing

### Running Tests

To run all UI tests:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

To run tests for a specific page:

```bash
npx playwright test src/uitests/pages/contact.spec.ts
```

To run tests in a specific browser:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

To run tests and open the HTML report:

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=html && npx playwright show-report
```

### Configuration

The Playwright configuration is in `playwright.config.ts` and includes:

- Multiple browser configurations (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile viewport testing
- Automatic screenshot capture on test failure
- HTML report generation

### Continuous Integration

UI tests are automatically run on GitHub Actions for pull requests and pushes to the main branch. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ui-tests.yml`.

## Testing

### Docker-Based Testing

This project uses Docker for consistent testing across all environments. Docker testing eliminates platform-specific issues (particularly with Rollup modules) and ensures tests run identically on all machines.

#### Quick Start

Run quick tests (unit + middleware):

```bash
npm run test:docker:quick
```

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test:docker
```

For pre-commit testing of affected components:

```bash
npm run test:docker:affected
```

## Email System

### Features

- **Dual Email Delivery**: Sends confirmation email to user and notification to admin
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 submissions per hour per IP address
- **Bot Protection**: Honeypot field to prevent automated spam
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failover for service reliability
- **Professional Templates**: HTML email templates with company branding

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in Azure Static Web Apps:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=hello@bridgingtrust.ai
EMAIL_TO=sales@bridgingtrust.ai
EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@bridgingtrust.ai
RESEND_TEST_MODE=false
```

### Testing

Test the email system locally or in production:

```bash
curl -X POST https://bridgingtrust.ai/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
