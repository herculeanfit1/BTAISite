feat: Comprehensive SSL and Docker CI implementation

This commit adds a complete SSL and Docker CI setup for the Bridging Trust AI website:

- Implemented flexible SSL configuration for development, CI, and production environments
- Added Docker configuration with Nginx for SSL termination and proxy
- Created scripts for automatic SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt
- Fixed TypeScript errors in blog categories page
- Updated next.config.js to use remotePatterns instead of deprecated domains
- Enhanced server.js with environment-specific configuration
- Added comprehensive documentation for deployment process
- Improved README with details about the infrastructure
- Added detailed code comments throughout the codebase

This implementation allows the site to run in three modes:
1. Development: Self-signed certificates (HTTPS)
2. CI/Testing: HTTP-only mode for testing
3. Production: Let's Encrypt certificates (HTTPS)

The Docker configuration includes three services:
- Next.js application
- Nginx for SSL termination and proxy
- Certbot for automatic certificate renewal

feat(navigation): Enhance navigation bar to match production site

- Improved layout with right-justified navigation buttons
- Enhanced Contact button with larger size and rounded corners 
- Increased header bar height by 30% for better visual hierarchy
- Increased logo and company name size by 30% for better brand prominence
- Added proper spacing between logo and company name
- Fixed server configuration to better handle HTTP/HTTPS ports
- Improved code documentation with comprehensive comments
- Updated README to document navigation improvements

This update ensures the dev environment navigation bar visually matches
the production site. The changes were implemented using inline styling for
precise control over dimensions and appearance, while maintaining the
responsive behavior for both desktop and mobile views.
