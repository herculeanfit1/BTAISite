## Email API Test Placeholder

The send-email.test.ts file has been temporarily removed due to CI compatibility issues.

Testing of the email API should be done through manual testing or local environment until the CI environment issues can be resolved.

To test the email API endpoint locally:

1. Start the local development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Use the provided test script:
   ```
   bash scripts/test-email-api-route.sh
   ```

Full testing will be re-introduced after deployment when the CI issues are resolved.
